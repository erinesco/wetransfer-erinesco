# WeTransfer - Erin Esco
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). The UI framework is [MaterialUI](https://material-ui.com/).
This is hosted at [https://erines.co/wetransfer-erinesco/](https://erines.co/wetransfer-erinesco/).

## Setup / Run instructions
Assumptions: some base web app setup on your computer

Make sure to install everything by running
`npm install`

After that, run `npm start` and a browser may auto launch depending on your browser if not visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

To run tests, run `npm test` and then type `a` to run all tests.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

Note: I'm not using this for the code reviewer, but leaving it here as an option.
